## Overview
The **Smart Waste Management System** leverages IoT to monitor and manage waste levels in dustbins efficiently. Using an ultrasonic sensor connected to a NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller, the system measures the garbage level in the bin and sends an alert when the bin is full. This can help streamline waste collection, reduce overflowing bins, and promote a cleaner environment.

## Features
- Detects the garbage level using an **ultrasonic sensor**.
- Sends alerts when the dustbin reaches a predefined threshold.
- Uses the **NodeMCU ESP8266** for wireless communication.
- Low power consumption.
- Scalable for multiple dustbins in a network.

## Hardware Requirements
- **NodeMCU ESP8266** (1 unit)
- **Ultrasonic Sensor** (e.g., HC-SR04) (1 unit)
- **12V Adapter** for power supply
- **Breadboard and jumper wires**
- **Dustbin** (physical setup)

---

## Software Requirements
- **Arduino IDE** (for programming the NodeMCU)
- **Wi-Fi connection** (for NodeMCU communication)
- Libraries required:
  - ESP8266WiFi
  - Ultrasonic.h (optional)

## Circuit Diagram
(Include or describe the circuit diagram here. You can use tools like Fritzing to create a visual diagram or explain it in text.)
1. Connect the **Trig** pin of the ultrasonic sensor to **D4** (GPIO 2) of NodeMCU.
2. Connect the **Echo** pin of the ultrasonic sensor to **D3** (GPIO 0).
3. Provide power to the ultrasonic sensor using **3.3V** and **GND** pins on the NodeMCU.
4. Connect the NodeMCU to a 12V adapter for external power supply.
